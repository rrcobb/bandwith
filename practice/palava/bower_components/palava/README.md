# palava

palava is a WebRTC library for the browser. It enables you to create PeerConnections to other browsers. It works together with [palava-machine](https://github.com/palavatv/palava-machine), an open source WebRTC signaling server written in Ruby. To see it in action, checkout [palava.tv](https://palava.tv) ([source](https://github.com/palavatv/palava-portal)).

## Setup

palava is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). However, if you want to only use it (not hack on it), just use option 1 or 2 to include the compiled JavaScript version:

### 1) bower

    $ bower install palava

This will install palava and its dependencies into a sub directory. Include all (palava, jQuery, eventEmitter) into your source file. For more information on bower, see [bower.io](http://bower.io/).

### 2) JS bundle file

Include a direct link to the source file into your HTML:

    <script src="https://path/to/palava.bundle.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

### 3) Browserify

See http://browserify.org

### 4) Sprockets/Middleman

Alternatively, you can directly include the coffee files into your project. See the [palava portal](https://github.com/palavatv/palava-portal) for how it is done.


## Documentation

The code is annotated and [API documentation](http://palavatv.github.io/) is
generated by Codo.

A [minimal example](https://gist.github.com/thammi/9005857) using JQuery is
available to illustrate the basic workflow.

For a complex example using AngularJS see `the palava-portal` code:
